Format SQL code using third-party SQL formatter tool.
ApexSQL Refactor is SSMS and Visual Studio add-in for format SQL code. ApexSQL Refactor provides over 200 formatting options that can be used to beautify a SQL code. In this part of the article, how to create a formatting profile and how to use some of the ApexSQL Refactor formatting options will be explained. Also, it will be shown how to format SQL code in a query editor using formatting profiles.

Besides formatting SQL code in a query editor directly, ApexSQL Refactor has features that can format code base SQL objects like stored procedures, functions, views and SQL scripts in batches. More about those formatting features can be found on the Beautify your SQL code using SQL formatter features page.

ApexSQL Refactor comes with four built-in formatting profiles that can be used out of the box to format SQL code.

Built-in ApexSQL Refactor SQL formatting profiles:

ApexSQL – this profile provides the best formatting style by ApexSQL opinion
Compact – all spacing options are unchecked, and indentions options set to 0 (zero) space for a query where the SQL code looks dense
Extended – Spaces and empty lines are added before/after every statement. This profile is opposite of the Compact profile
MSDN SQL BOL – mimic the style from the MSDN resource site
These four formatting profiles among the rest of ApexSQL Refactor formatting options are located under the Options window:.
